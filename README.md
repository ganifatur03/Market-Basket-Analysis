### Project Title
**Market Basket Analysis on Online Retail Data**

### Introduction
This project conducts a Market Basket Analysis on an online retail dataset using the Apriori algorithm. The analysis involves identifying patterns in customer purchase behavior, visualizing item frequencies, and exploring associations between items in transactions.

### Installation
1. Ensure R is installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages by running the following commands in your R environment:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("arules", "arulesViz", "ggplot2", "grid", "lubridate", "tidyverse"))
   ```

### Usage
1. **Load the dataset**: The script loads an online retail dataset (`online_retail_II.csv`). You may need to adjust the file path to match your environment.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the R script to perform Market Basket Analysis, generate item frequency plots, and visualize transactions by month.
3. **Visualizations**: The script includes code for plotting item frequencies and transaction counts per month.

### Features
- **Item Frequency Visualization**: Generates absolute and relative frequency plots for the top 10 items.
- **Transaction Visualization**: Displays the number of transactions per month.
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Implements the Apriori algorithm for different support and confidence levels to generate association rules.

### Dependencies
- **R Packages**:
  - `arules`
  - `arulesViz`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `grid`
  - `lubridate`
  - `tidyverse`

### Configuration
- **Dataset Path**: Ensure that the `online_retail_II.csv` file is correctly located. The script currently points to a specific directory, which may need modification.

### Documentation
The script is structured and commented to help understand the steps involved in the analysis:
- **Loading Data**: Reading the dataset and converting it into a transaction format.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of item frequencies and monthly transactions.
- **Association Rules**: Applying the Apriori algorithm and generating rules based on varying support and confidence levels.

### Examples
To generate the frequency plots:
```r
itemFrequencyPlot(data_retail, topN=10, col="darkseagreen4", type="absolute", ylab="Frekuensi (absolut)", main="Frekuensi Penjualan Barang")
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Dataset Issues**: Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly and the file path is accurate.
- **Package Installation**: If packages fail to install, check your R setup and ensure you have internet access.
